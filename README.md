 Shows how to use wclGetErrorInfo function

Wireless Communication Library (https://www.btframework.com/wcl.htm) includes very usefull function **wclGetErrorInfo()** that can be used by your applications to translate WCL error codes into human readable description.

The function can read errors information from XML file located on our site (https://ww.btframework.com/errors.xml) or from local copy of this file.

The file on the site is always up to date. However using local file does not require internet access and for some reason can be better.

This very simple demo applications show how to use this function. Should you have any questions please contact us at support@btframework.com
